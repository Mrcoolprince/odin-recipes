    <p>Waffles are a delicious breakfast treat made from a batter that is cooked between two hot plates, creating a crispy exterior and a soft, fluffy interior.  <br>
        They are often served with syrup, whipped cream, fresh fruit, or even ice cream.  <br>
        Waffles can be enjoyed plain or topped with various ingredients, making them a versatile dish for any meal of the day.</p>
    <p>There are many types of waffles, including Belgian waffles, which are thicker and have deeper pockets for holding toppings, and American waffles, which are thinner and denser.  <br>
        Some waffles are even made with yeast, giving them a unique flavor and texture. <br>
        Waffles can be sweet or savory, and they are often enjoyed at breakfast or brunch, but they can also be served as a dessert or snack.</p>
