    <p>Lasagna is a delicious <strong> Italian dish </strong>made with layers of flat pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy cheese, and sometimes vegetables. 
        Each layer is stacked neatly, usually topped with a generous amount of melted cheese that becomes golden and bubbly when baked. 
        The flavors blend together perfectly, creating a warm and hearty meal that many people enjoy for dinner or special gatherings.</p>

        <p>The traditional lasagna recipe uses a meat-based sauce like Bolognese and a white sauce called b√©chamel, but there are many variations.
            Some versions are made with spinach, mushrooms, or even seafood. 
            Whether made with meat or vegetables, lasagna is loved for its comforting taste and satisfying layers. 
            It's often served hot and pairs well with a simple salad or garlic bread.</p>
