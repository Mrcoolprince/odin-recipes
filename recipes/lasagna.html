    <p>Lasagna is a delicious <strong> Italian dish </strong>made with layers of flat pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy cheese, and sometimes vegetables. <br>
        Each layer is stacked neatly, usually topped with a generous amount of melted cheese that becomes golden and bubbly when baked. <br>
        The flavors blend together perfectly, creating a warm and hearty meal that many people enjoy for dinner or special gatherings.</p>

        <p>The traditional lasagna recipe uses a meat-based sauce like Bolognese and a white sauce called béchamel, but there are many variations. <br>
            Some versions are made with spinach, mushrooms, or even seafood. <br>
            Whether made with meat or vegetables, lasagna is loved for its comforting taste and satisfying layers. <br>
            It's often served hot and pairs well with a simple salad or garlic bread.</p>
