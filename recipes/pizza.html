    <p>Pizza is a popular dish that originated in Italy, consisting of a round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients.  <br>
        It is typically baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.  <br>
        Pizza is often served hot and can be sliced into wedges or squares for easy sharing.</p>
    <p>There are many variations of pizza, with different toppings and styles.  <br>
        Some popular toppings include pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, olives, and bell peppers.<br>
        Pizza can be made with a thin crust, thick crust, or even stuffed crust.  <br>
        It is often enjoyed as a quick meal or snack and is a favorite at parties and gatherings.</p>
